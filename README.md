# LightUp Shoes Plus Plus

This is the code to make a normal [lightup shoes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M0CIM0Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) measure step count when you walk and play music when you reach some milestones. We hacked the sensors on a light-up shoe and attached it with a 7-segment display and a speaker. Now, walking is more fun than usual!
